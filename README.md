This is a Travel App design that is responsive made using HTML and Tailwind CSS with an intention of exploring Tailwind.

It is mainly made with the intend of using it as mobile design.

The 'assets' folder contains the pictures used in this project

The dist folder contains the HTML files. It also contains the 'output.css' file which contains the default TailwindCss code.

I also have installed node modules by running the command 'npm i node-modules'. This step created a 'node modules' folder in the project directory.

Next comes the src folder which contains the 'input.css' file which has the code from the Tailwind directives from the Tailwind Css docs [ Here's the link to it! https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation ]
